# Marina

> 3/4/2012
> Sitting in the humid breeze somewhere along Dubai marina. All around me construction workers toil to build ever-taller tower blocks.
> 
> Everything here is new, or at least it seems that way to me.
> 
> People stroll by taking photographs every now and then.
> 
> Despite the dirl of power tools and the hum of endless air conditioning, it is peaceful here.
> 
> The scale of buildings here is amazing. Most surrounding my palm-bench island stand at least 20 - 40 storeys high.
> 
> Likewise the meandering walkway beside the water seems to go on for ever. Gone are my hopes of walking right around it for now I don't believe it possible.
> 
> Ah well, another corner tempts me onwards on my never ending quest.

> Back at Costa in Emirates HQ. Tired now but it's been a good trip to the marina.
> 
> The metro ride back just echoes the harbour -- everywhere there are tall buildings being put up into the sky.
> 
> There's a pleasant fountain in the central atrium here, and about eight floors of offices overlooking the concourse as I do now.
