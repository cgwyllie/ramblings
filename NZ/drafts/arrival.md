So I arrive, and its been a tolerable ordeal to fly for 8 hours because of delays. Not terribly comfortable, but bearable.

Sunset over the clouds was immense. I was fortunate enough to have a window seat, and the views were spectacular at points. I often wonder when looking out of aircraft if I'm sitting in a studio somewhere with ever changing film reels played back outside the windows. It seems so unreal.

Dubai airport is incredible. It's a shining example of modernity and the embodiment of architecturally expressed statements of wealth.

It's so large they have little cars to drive people to baggage claim or to other gates. As the awe ebbed slightly I felt lost: the signs which had promised baggage claim split into baggage claim, passport control, and visa collection -- each in a different direction.

After seeking help from the emirates desk, I queued my way through passport control to the freedom of the baggage hall, a structure whose scale would be at home as a dwarven mines set from the lord of the rings.

Hand luggage X-ray. I'm halted by a friendly yet concerned looking young man only a year older than me. He rakes around through my baggage and ruffles all the stuff up. After a while, he seems to lose interest and without explicitly saying as much, I'm free to go.

Toilet break. What is the soap for the toilet paper all about?

Baggage claim. I have a trolley. Good. Easy, now on to the taxi rank. The signs at this point all agree on the way out, but as I approach the final exit, I'm stopped by a woman who asks me to step to the side for a moment.

> "How old are you? What is your job?"

Her questions punctuate my polite yet confused responses as she too rummages in my bag. The alarm clock is of particular interest to her too. I knew I should have left it at home.

I am all too eager to explain the oversize holdall with bedding in it and have to slow helpful ramblings as I notice her concern grow. It all makes sense after a moment, and I'm free to go.

Fresh air, it's a balmy 24 degrees and about 2AM. I'm approached by a man in a shirt who I assume wants to examine my possessions as well, but it turns out he wants to sell me a taxi ride.

Perfect. How much? 100AED! No, sorry, it should be 30 I was told. 80 is best price? No sort I think not. As I turn I see the official taxi rank with lines of beige cabs. Relief. Where to? Premier inn. OK. Meter looks like it'll be about right, but oh wait, there's a free bus? Ah screw it, I'm tired.

No room under Wyllie, card declined, phone not working, no payphone. Shit.
